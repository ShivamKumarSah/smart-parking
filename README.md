# ParCar - Elevating Parking Solutions

ParCar is a cutting-edge Android application that transforms urban parking by harnessing the power of Computer Vision Technology and an AI Chatbot, named Parker. Our solution addresses the pervasive issues of inefficient parking management, real-time parking information gaps, traffic congestion, and driver frustration. With a holistic approach, ParCar optimizes parking space utilization, reduces environmental impact, and enhances the overall parking experience.

## Problem Statement

Inefficient Parking Management:

Time Wasted: Studies show that drivers in the US waste an average of 17 hours per year searching for parking.
Fuel Consumption: The search for parking contributes to an extra 3.7 billion gallons of gas burned annually in the US.
Driver Stress: Frustration in finding parking significantly increases driver stress levels.
Street Parking and Congestion:
Space Utilization: Traditional parking garages operate at 60% capacity, while automated systems can increase this to 80-90%.
Traffic Flow: Street parking can reduce traffic flow by up to 30%, creating bottlenecks and congestion.
Accidents: Improper on-street parking increases the risk of accidents.

## Solution

ParCar leverages Computer Vision Technology and an AI Chatbot, Parker, to provide:

Instant Parking Updates: Real-time information without user input, streamlining the parking process.
Dynamic Pricing: Incentivizing parking in designated lots based on street parking costs.
Seamless Interface: User-friendly app design for efficient booking.
Differentiators:
Cost-Effective: Utilizes CCTV cameras for spot detection, avoiding the need for multiple sensors.
AI Chatbot: Enhances user interaction, navigating government regulations seamlessly.
Technical Soundness: OpenCV algorithms for real-time analysis, powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo-1106.
